## Introduction

This unit of the course involves the investigation and implementation of various mapping and SLAM algorithms. 
Localization is the process of estimating a robot's pose in an assumed known environment. Mapping assumes you know the robot path
and estimates the map of the environment.

Both of these concepts form one of the most fundamental conecepts of mobile robotics - SLAM. SLAM involves the
process of localizing a robot in a map while a simulatenously creating that map from known positions.

The following are 5 of 5 categories of SLAM algorithms:

* Extended Kalman Filter SLAM (EKF)
* Sparse Extended Information Filter (SEIF)
* Extended Information Form (EIF)
* FastSLAM
* GraphSLAM
